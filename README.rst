Âµrecord
=======

``Record`` is a simple metaclass for creating classes whose instances are
designed to hold a fixed number of named fields. It's similar to
``collections.namedtuple()`` in its operation, only it uses metaclasses rather
than string formatting and ``exec``.

    >>> import math
    >>> from urecord import Record
    >>> class CartesianPoint(Record('x', 'y')):
    ...     def to_polar(self):
    ...         angle = math.atan2(self.y, self.x)
    ...         radius = math.sqrt(self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2)
    ...         return PolarPoint(angle, radius)
    >>> class PolarPoint(Record('angle', 'radius')):
    ...     def to_cartesian(self):
    ...         x = self.radius * math.cos(self.angle)
    ...         y = self.radius * math.sin(self.angle)
    ...         return CartesianPoint(x, y)
    >>> p1 = CartesianPoint(3, 4)
    >>> p1
    CartesianPoint(x=3, y=4)
    >>> p2 = p1.to_polar()
    >>> p2
    PolarPoint(angle=0.927..., radius=5.0)
    >>> p2._replace(angle=0.25)
    PolarPoint(angle=0.25, radius=5.0)
    >>> p2._asdict()
    {'radius': 5.0, 'angle': 0.927...}
